## ⚙️ Development Notes

### Code Formatting with Prettier

This project uses [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for code formatting. It's helpful to have Prettier installed globally for consistent code styling. Here’s a `.prettierrc` configuration file used in the project:

### Local Development

I recommend using a tool like [serve](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve) to develop this project.

### No Package Manager

This project doesn't use Yarn or NPM. All necessary scripts and libraries are linked directly in the HTML file.

### Main Files

- `index.html`: Contains the structure of the webpage.
- `index.js`: Contains the JavaScript logic for handling PDF files and extracting text.

## 📄 License

This project is open-source, and the code is available under the MIT license. Feel free to use, modify, and distribute it as per your needs.

## 🙏 Acknowledgements
